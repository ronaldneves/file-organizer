# file-organizer

python source code for a simple file organizer i've made to keep some folders less messy hehehe
creates 5 folders: Installers, Media Files, Documents, Compact Files and "Etc", then moves files based on its extension to the proper folder.
i also used PyInstaller to create an .exe file to make it easier to execute and share, but the .exe file is not available on this repo.

## v0.0.1
- stores the format type on a list
- checks the file format and move it to a folder based on the element of the list that corresponds to the folder's name

## future changes
- group the different lists that deals with the file formats in a dictionary with nested lists
- change some variables to make the code more readable
- add support to excel files
